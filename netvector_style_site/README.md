# Your IT Company – Static Site Starter

This is an **original** multi-page static website inspired by the structure of established UK IT MSP sites.
It includes HTML, CSS and a small JS for mobile navigation, plus sitemap and robots.txt.

## Quick start
1. Open `index.html` in your browser or upload the folder to any static host (Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3, IIS).
2. Search & replace **Your IT Company** and `example.com` with your details.
3. Edit pages in the root `.html` files and `assets/css/styles.css` for styling.

## Notes
- Text is original (not copied).
- Replace placeholders (phone, address, email).
- Contact form is non-functional; hook it up to your backend/form service if needed.
